                    3. Information Sharing
                    In order to provide some of our Services and processing activities, we use service providers and may need to share information with these service providers and certain other third parties, including our group of companies, in the following circumstances:
                    Our Group of Companies. We may share information with certain      companies in our corporate family so we can provide you with information      about products and services, both travel-related and others, which might      interest you and to provide payment services. This sharing also allows us      to better understand how you interact with the websites, apps and services      of our group companies. These      companies will comply with this Statement and all      applicable laws governing the transmission of promotional communications.
                    Suppliers. We may share information with certain suppliers used to      facilitate our Services, including where relevant to help with      transactions.
                    Business Partners. We may share information about you, your Devices      and your use of our Services with our trusted business partners. For      example, we may share information so that we can facilitate payment for      products or services you may purchase on the websites of our partners.      This sharing is generally pursuant to written agreements which include      confidentiality, privacy, and security obligations; please note, however,      that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party business      partners.
                    Social Media Websites. When you use our Services and elect to share      information with third-party social media websites, the information you      share will be governed by the privacy policies of those social media      websites and the privacy settings you have set with those social media      websites.
                    Advertising Networks. We sometimes collect and share information      about your interests with advertising networks and data aggregators. Some      of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or      the Digital Advertising Alliance,      which offer a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member      companies. To learn more about the Digital Advertising Alliance.
                    Fraud Detection Companies. Third parties may assist us by providing      us with their fraud detection technologies.
                    Other third parties, such as referring websites. Third parties may      also assist us in collecting information by, for example, operating      features of our website or facilitating the delivery of online advertising      tailored to your interests. We may share audience segments and other      information, such as hashed email addresses, with third parties that use      that information for tailored advertising to you. Other third parties may      also provide us with their content and contract generation, management,      and hosting tools. Third parties may only collect or access information as      needed to perform their permitted functions. If and to the extent these      third parties only assist us to perform our processing operations, we have      bound them contractually to only act on our behalf as so-called data      processors.
                    Certain Device operating system versions permit you to opt out of certain types of information sharing, including to certain advertising networks. You can change the privacy settings of your Device at any time in order to turn off the functionality that collects and shares location information. Please check your Device settings if you want to limit such tracking However, turning off location-sharing may affect certain features that we offer. If you have any questions about the privacy settings of your Device, we suggest you contact the manufacturer of your Device or your mobile service provider for help.
                    We also may share your information if we believe, in our sole discretion, that such disclosure is necessary:
                    To comply with legitimate and enforceable subpoenas, court orders,      or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to      defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such      cases, we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right      available to us.
                    To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or      suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property,      or safety of travel VietNam, our customers, or others; and in connection with      our Terms of Use and other agreements.
                    In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture,      merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of      bankruptcy.
                     
                    4. Information Choices
                    You have options with respect to the processing and use of your information by us. You can access, update, and even close your account by visiting the “Member Profile” section on our website or app. In addition, you can do the following:
                    Choose the way we communicate with you.

                    Prevent the collection of certain geolocation information (e.g. by      switching off location services for our app in the settings of your      phone), but note that turning off location sharing may affect certain      features of our Services.
                    Close your account directly from within your Member Profile. Note      that if you close your account, we will deactivate your account and remove      your profile information from active view.

                    5. Information on Children

                    We will only collect or process information belonging to children under very limited circumstances. We might need to collect personal information belonging to children as part of our Service if, for example, the personal information is required as part of a travel-related reservation. We will only collect personal information belonging to children if it is provided by and with consent of a parent or guardian. If we become aware that we have processed the personal information of a child without the valid consent of a parent or guardian, we will delete the personal information.
                     
                    6. Information Transfers

                    7. Information Security
                    We have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help protect your information. We only authorize specific personnel to access personal information and they may do so only for permitted business functions. We use encryption when transmitting your information between your system and ours, and between our system and those of the parties with whom we share information. We also employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized access to your information. However, we cannot guarantee the security of information from unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, or other circumstances outside of our control.
                     
                    8. Information Deletion and Retention
                    We will retain copies of your information for as long as you maintain your account or as necessary in connection with the purposes set out in this Statement, unless applicable law requires a longer retention period. In addition, we may retain your information for the duration of any period necessary to establish, exercise, or defend any legal rights.
                     
                    9. Information from Cookies
                    We want your access to our Services to be as easy, efficient, and useful as possible. To help us do this, we use cookies and similar technologies to improve your experience, to enhance website security, and to show you relevant advertising.
                    10. Information on Statement Changes
